Twitter Application-only Authentication (OAuth) using PHP
====================================================
Provides a set of functions to allow authentication via Twitter's Application-only authentication protocol.
Methods include the following:
 * getting bearer token
 * invalidating bearer token
 * simple search function

If you wish to use this script you will have to have registered your application with Twitter via dev.twitter.com
Then modify lines 14 and 15 to reflect your consumer key and consumer secret.
At the bottom of the script you will see a demo of getting a bearer token, using the bearer token to perform a search
and then invalidating the token.
